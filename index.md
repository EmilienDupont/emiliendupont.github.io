I'm a PhD student in machine learning at [Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/), supervised by [Yee Whye Teh](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~teh/) and [Arnaud Doucet](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/) and funded by [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/).

My recent research interests include invertible neural networks, flow-based models  and [continuous depth neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01681). I'm also interested in the intersection of physics and machine learning and especially how we can build models that combine learning from data with physical principles. I've also worked on [neural rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07630) during an internship at [Apple](https://apple.com/) and am very interested in how we can use graphics renderers to make computer vision algorithms more robust and interpretable.

Previously, I've worked on [disentanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00104), [inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03065) and its [applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03728) to various physical problems.

Before my PhD, I worked for 2 years as a machine learning scientist at [STIC](http://www.slb.com/about/rd/technology/stic.aspx) in the Bay Area. I studied [computational maths](https://icme.stanford.edu/) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) and theoretical physics at [Imperial College](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/).
